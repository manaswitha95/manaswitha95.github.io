    <p>Im <strong >Manaswitha</strong> </p>
    <p>In a nutshell , I would like to rewind what I have done in <strong>2018 </strong></p>
    <p>To start with , I have taken 2 courses at NEU during the spring semester </p>
    <ol type="1"> 
      <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
      <li>Algorithms</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Early May, I started my first job as a data science intern at Channing division of network medicine, Brigham and women's Hospital</p>
    <p> It has been a great experience working with an amazing team of physicians, bioinformaticians and researchers on COPD omics data</p>
    <ol type="I">
      <li>genomics</li>
      <li>machinelearning</li>
      <li>Deeplearning</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Late December, I have been to an adventurous vacation with my family to South east Asia.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>cruising</li>
      <li>highlands</li>
      <li>flyerrides</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well I would say that I had experienced manythings for the first time ever in <strong>2018 </strong></p>
